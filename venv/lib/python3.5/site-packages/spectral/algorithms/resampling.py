    data value is constant over its FWHM (since we do not know the true
    spectral load over the source band) and the destination band has a Gaussian
    response function. Any target bands that do not have any overlapping source
    bands will contain NaN as the resampled band value.

    are assumed to have FWHM values that span half the distance to the adjacent
