class LinearTransform:
    '''A callable linear transform object.

    In addition to the __call__ method, which applies the transform to given,
    data, a LinearTransform object also has the following members:

        `dim_in` (int):

            The expected length of input vectors. This will be `None` if the
            input dimension is unknown (e.g., if the transform is a scalar).

        `dim_out` (int):

            The length of output vectors (after linear transformation). This
            will be `None` if the input dimension is unknown (e.g., if
            the transform is a scalar).

        `dtype` (numpy dtype):

            The numpy dtype for the output ndarray data.
    '''
    def __init__(self, A, **kwargs):
        '''Arguments:

            `A` (:class:`~numpy.ndarrray`):

                An (J,K) array to be applied to length-K targets.

        Keyword Argments:

            `pre` (scalar or length-K sequence):

                Additive offset to be applied prior to linear transformation.

            `post` (scalar or length-J sequence):

                An additive offset to be applied after linear transformation.

            `dtype` (numpy dtype):

                Explicit type for transformed data.

        Arguments:

            `X` (:class:`~numpy.ndarray` or object with `transform` method):

                If `X` is an ndarray, it is either an (M,N,K) array containing
                M*N length-K vectors to be transformed or it is an (R,K) array
                of length-K vectors to be transformed. If `X` is an object with
                a method named `transform` the result of passing the
                `LinearTransform` object to the `transform` method will be
                returned.

        Returns an (M,N,J) or (R,J) array, depending on shape of `X`, where J
        is the length of the first dimension of the array `A` passed to
        __init__.
