Python wrapper for `OSQP <https://osqp.org/>`__: the Operator
Splitting QP Solver.

The OSQP (Operator Splitting Quadratic Program) solver is a numerical
optimization package for solving problems in the form

::

    minimize        0.5 x' P x + q' x

    subject to      l <= A x <= u

where ``x in R^n`` is the optimization variable. The objective function
is defined by a positive semidefinite matrix ``P in S^n_+`` and vector
``q in R^n``. The linear constraints are defined by matrix
``A in R^{m x n}`` and vectors ``l in R^m U {-inf}^m``,
``u in R^m U {+inf}^m``.

Documentation

The interface is documented `here <https://osqp.org/>`__.
